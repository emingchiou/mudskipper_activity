Following are the manual:

A. System maintainence:

1. "recording": record vedio by webcam (through raspeberry pi).
2. "temp_display":  show temperature on LCD.
3. "temperature_sensor": record temperature to SD card.
4. "time_calibration":  calibrate RTC.
5. "valve_test cycle": short tidalcycle for testing updated protocol.
6. "valve2": control the valve and pump.
7. "valve_fw_sw": fw and sw tide.
	
B. Data analysis:

1. Be sure to prepare a set of timetag of frames, cordination output from deelabcut, recording videos.
   Template data are in file "data".
2. Go to "initiate" to setup the condition of the experiment.
3. Go to "main" to start analysis.

C. Template data:

Data of one individual were available for analysis, but the raw video were not supplied.
1. mudA-1:cordination output from deelabcut.
2. mudA:timetag of frames.
